# What is LoRa/LoRaWAN???

## 1. LoRa : wireless MODULATION used to create long-range communication link (End Device)

- https://medium.com/kgxperience/what-happens-in-lora-lorawan-communication-ab32d56dfc71
- made by Semtech
- Physical Layer protocol
- Chirp Spread Spectrum(CSS) Modulation : 915MHz(USA)
    - low-frequency modulation
    - higher sensitivity → enabling long-distance connectivity
    - 8 up chirps followed by 2 down chirps… and then data
- Power (Watt, W)
    - RF signal can be measured by Watt (W) using amplitude
    - $dBm = 10log^P(P : power, W)$
- Receive Sensitivity a minimum power that can receive signal
    - LoRa receiver is really sensitive, down to -148dBm
- RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) ( - dBm; absolute)
    - https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/rssi-and-snr/
    - received signal strength, receive power, check if signal strength is strong enough to get a good wireless communication
    - LoRa에서는 RSSI = -30dBm: strong, RSSI = -120dBm: weak
    - help to determine if the received signal is strong enough to get a good wireless connection
    - important for both gateways and end devices
    - closer to zero → received signal is stronger
    - influenced by Path loss, Antenna gain, Cable/connector loss
- SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) (dB; relative)
    - demodulation의 기준이 되는 신호의 quality
    - LoRa에서는 -20dB and +10dB 사이
    - ratio of the received signal power to the noise floor
    - commonly used to determine the quality of the received signal
    - SNR(dB) = RSSI(dBm) - noise floor(dBm)
        - noise floor : amount of noise generated by the device
    - if the RSSI is above the noise floor(= positive SNR), the receiver can easily demodulate the signal

    - if negative SNR, it is impossible to demodulate the signal BUT LoRa CAN!!!

- Transmission Parameters
    - carrier frequency (CF)
        - just frequency
        - different frequencies + other info. → channels
        - LoRa는 각각의 message마다 random하게 channel을 지정함
        - 하나의 channel에 대응되는 BW와 SF가 존재함
    - bandwidth (BW) = chip rate (chips/sec = Hz)
        - range from CF - (1/2)BW to CF + (1/2)BW
        - 125kHz, 250kHz, 500kHz,
        - BW ⬆ → DR ⬆ → ToA ⬇
    - 🌟🌟🌟SPREADING FACTOR (SF)
        - https://blog.ttulka.com/lora-spreading-factor-explained/
        - 주어진 channel의 BW내에서 frequency의 변화 속도, Signal의 특성
        - speed at which the signal frequency changes across the bandwidth of a channel in the time unit
        - distance ⬆ → SF ⬆ → DR ⬇ → data sent slowly → ToA ⬆ → SNR ⬆  → receiver sensitivity ⬆
        - different SF → orthogonal = received concurrently
        - SF ⬆ → receiver sensitivity ⬆
        - 🌟신호의 세기(RSSI)가 weak → SF ⬆ → receiver sensitivity ⬆, 즉 weak한 신호라도 receiver에서 받을 수 있음
        - for each SF, there is a SNR limit(∵demodulation을 해야하기 때문)

            - Ex. SF=7의 signal일 때 SNR이 -7.5dB보다 작으면 demodulation 불가능
            - Receiver Sensitivity(S)는 BW, NF(receiver Noise Figure), SNR_limit에 의해 계산가능

                - NF는 hardward implementation에 의해 고정
                - SNR_limit은 SF에 의해 달라짐

    - coding rate (CR)
        - $CR = 4 / (4 + CR), CR = 1, 2, 3, 4$
        - proportion of the transmitted bits that actually carries info.
        - rest of them are for error correction
- half-duplex; bidirectional but not simultaneous
- reduce the amount of energy consumption

— by using asynchronous communication; end nodes only sends data when it is scheduled to ‘wake up’ or has data to send

- duty cycle
    - Ex. total allowed uplink ToA is 86400 sec(= one day) * 1% duty cycle = 864 seconds per day, per device

- some other metrics
    - Chip Rate = BW
    - Symbol Rate
    - Data Rate (DR; bits / sec)
        - also called Bit Rate (bits/sec)
        - computed by Bandwidth(BW), Spreading Factor(SF), Coding Rate(CR)

        - BW ⬆ → DR ⬆
        - distance ⬆ → SF ⬆ → DR ⬇
        - CR ⬆ → DR ⬇
- 🌟Adaptive Data Rate (ADR)

    - goal : minimize energy consumption, maximize throughput
    - distance ⬇ → power ⬇ → SF ⬇ → DR ⬆
    - only for fixed end node
    - network server에서 받은 20개의 uplink message 중 maximum SNR(SNR_measured)을 고름, for less power
    - margin을 최소화하는 방향으로 SF, BW, Transmission power, CR 설정
        - $margin = SNRmeasured - SNRlimit-default margin$
    - US902-928 : SF7BW125 ~ SF10BW125
